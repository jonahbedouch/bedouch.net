# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to the blog section of my website. This section isn't necessarily going to be computer science related, it's just going to contain 
whatever ramblings I feel like putting out into the world at the moment. Given that, it might be worthwhile for you to know a little bit about 
who I am.

# Me 
Hi! I'm Jonah. As the site hero mentions, at the time of writing this I am just starting my third year of college at UC Berkeley, studying 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (emphasis on the Computer Science). A bulk of my interest in the field is in frontend, systems, and 
cyber security. Outside of CS, I enjoy teaching, brewing and drinking coffee, listening to music, and learning about random esoteric things. I 
am also an advocate for sustainable transportation and affordable housing, so you will sometimes catch me at Berkeley City Council meetings. 

Overall, I typically spend my time doing whatever I find interesting in the moment, so I am often somewhat sporadic. For instance, at the start 
of the summer I impulsively spent 2 days creating a [link shortener](https://l.bedouch.net/l.bedouch.net) that uses a Github Gist as a database 
and Next.js as a router just because the thought entered my mind that it was possible and then I had to do it.

## Coffee Setup
One may be curious as to what I brew on/with. Currently, I grind my coffee using a [DF54 Grinder](https://www.turingrinders.com/products/turin-df54-single-dose-flat-burr-grinder) 
and pull espresso using a [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Gaggia-RI9380-46-Espresso-Stainless/dp/B07RQ3NL76). When making milk drinks, 
my milk of choice is [Minor Figures Barista Oatmilk](https://us.minorfigures.com/products/organic-oat-milk) and I source my coffee from whatever local 
coffee shop I'm enjoying that week (usually [Mind Coffee](https://www.themindcoffee.com/) or [Jaffa Coffee Roasters](https://www.jaffacoffee.com/)). 
When I don't feel like espresso, I will brew a [Hario v60](https://global.hario.com/v60/v60series.html) using [James Hoffman's v60 method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo).
Note that none of these links are affiliate links or anything, I just like sharing the things that work for me.

## Music 
I listen to a lot of music from all sorts of artists across many genres. I tend to come back to pop and folk punk, indie rock, and bedroom pop most 
frequently, but I listen to a whole lot of everything in large quantities. Someday I might make a widget for this site, but until then you can check 
out my listening stats, including who and what I'm enjoying at the moment, on my [last.fm](https://music.bedouch.net).

# Introduction
Welcome to the second iteration of my personal webpage. This site is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), 
using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling and [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) to render markdown (such as this 
project post) into HTML. This site was one of my first attempts at using Next.js, and it has been really useful in understanding both how Next works and in 
developing a deeper understanding for how React works. 

# Goals
Most projects start with a set of goals. With this site, I was aiming to accomplish the following things: 

1. Ensure that writing blog posts and project writeups is simple and achievable in a short time span.
2. Ensure that the website is semantically marked up and accessible for users that are relying on assistive technologies such as screen readers.
3. Minimize page load time and avoid layout shift.
4. Keep the website visually appealing, striking a balance between a playful and professional vibe.
5. Allow for easy retheming of the site, and potentially more playful "seasonal" themes.

Lets discuss the motivations for each of these a little bit more in-depth.

## Simple posts
Writing is hard, and even when working in a Word document it can take a while for me to articulate a point effectively. Knowing this about myself, I didn't want to 
make the barrier of entry for adding new content to this site any higher than it already is, out of fear that I simply wouldn't do it. As such, I wanted as much of the 
site as possible to be modifiable in an easy manner. There are several ways to accomplish this, such as using a WYSIWYG service like Squarespace, a Content Management System 
like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), or using Markdown. For many reasons, I was not interested in using a website builder, so I quickly ruled that option out. Opting for Markdown 
over a Headless CMS, on the other hand, was mostly a decision made for financial reasons. I knew that I wanted to delpoy on the cloud, and most CMS solutions are immediately not 
ideal in this use case due to high costs. Further, using a CMS would likely increase page load times, as content would need to be fetched from a separate service. Markdown, 
on the other hand, could be stored in the same GitHub repository as the website itself, and could be rendered at compile time or whenever the markdown is updated, enabling 
snappy page loads and a relatively easy authoring experience. Something that was unknown to me at the time when staring this project but ended up turning out in my favor is that 
[Google Docs recently gained support for exporting Docs to Markdown](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/07/import-and-export-markdown-in-google-docs.html), 
which makes the experience of authoring Markdown posts even simpler than before.

## Accessibility
Web accessibility is incredibly important, so much so that having a deeper explanation here almost feels moot. Semantic markup and accessibility is often something that gets 
neglected on the web, but its an incredibly important part of making sure that the world is equally accessible for everyone, which is something that I think is important. The 
specific goal for this website was that I wanted to target [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) standards, inspired by the fact that UC Berkeley was mandated 
to comply with the same set of standards. However, I also wanted to have the opportunity to work towards WCAG 2.0 AAA compliance going forward. I accomplished this using the robust 
theming system that I will dicuss later, which could enable me to make high contrast modes and other important changes to work towards AAA compliance down the road. While I have no 
way of actually validating that my website is in compliance, I have taken care to ensure that it complies to the best of my knowledge. If there is ever anything that you see that 
is not WCAG 2.0 AA compliant that I missed (outside of seasonal themes), please [let me know](mailto:jonah@bedouch.net).

## Pageload
Like accessibility, providing a deep explanation for this is difficult. On one hand, the web is very commonly accessed on mobile devices that do not have access to large amounts of 
bandwidth, so minimizing the page load helps maximize the experience for everyone. On the other, it also improves SEO drastically. With this in mind, the design of most websites on 
the internet is dictated by pageload. This was particularly important for me going into this redesign, however, because my previous website did an incredibly poor job with both pageload 
and layout shift, since it didn't cache anything and had to recompute each endpoint on the fly every time it was accessed — an oversight on my part. My main motivation behind selecting 
Next.js, other than to learn it, was this. Next handles caching pretty effectively on its own, and allows for features like optimized images and react suspsense that allow page load to 
speed up while minimizing layout shift.

## Visual Appeal
A good looking website is everyone's goal. Early concepts for this site relied on a custom, iPadOS-like cursor and a large number of animations to achieve a more application-like look. 
However, I felt that this took away from the overall look of the site, since it made it feel more like a show piece than it did an actual website that was meant to be interacted with. Thus, 
I aimed to strike a balance between playful and professional, opting to keep some of the elements of early drafts (such as the emoji grid in the background), while relying on native 
browser interactions and adding some playful [Josh W Comeau-inspired boops](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/) in some places to keep the website playful. Overall, I really like how the 
site ended up looking, and I think there's a lot of room to do fun things in the future.

## Theming
One idea that I've been particularly fond of since I started working on the first draft of my first website is the idea of seasonal themes — playful color variants of my website that appear
around holidays and may be more rough around the edges than the main light or dark mode.

I've been partial to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) ever since Tailwind 2 came out. 
The idea of using inline classes to implement styles just works for me, and it makes developing things really quick compared to when I have to work out CSS classes on my own. However, one of 
Tailwind's downsides is that it makes it much harder to offer multiple themes for a site. With traditional CSS, you can declare all of your colors as CSS variables, then reference the colors 
you like whenever you need. If you're using a CSS preprocessor, this is even easier since you can rely on commands like `darken()` or `lighten()` to generate variants of a small number of base 
colors specified. 

For this reason, my old website relied on hand-styled CSS, which made it more difficult for me to maintain. With this site, I wanted to return to Tailwind while keeping the 
ability to create time-dependent themes. I accomplished this using the [`tw-colors`](https://github.com/L-Blondy/tw-colors) Tailwind plugin, which allows custom themes to be specified within 
Tailwind, with each theme being able to declare its own named colors that can be referenced using Tailwind's declarative classes.

Relying on this, I was able to write a script that is sent in the header of the website which checks which theme the user has selected in local storage and configures the tw-colors theme to 
match. Pairing this with [`rehype-pretty-code`](https://github.com/rehype-pretty/rehype-pretty-code), which allowed me to use [Shiki's](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) theme options, I was 
able to create a full-site custom theming system that allows for seasonal themes, and can allow for a high contrast theme in the future.

# Inspirations

This site was inspired heavily by elements of [patrickyoussef.com](https://patrickyoussef.com) and [joshwcomeau.com](https://joshwcomeau.com). It uses spacing and clamps from [utopia design](https://utopia.fyi)
to make sure that the content looks good on all screen sizes.

# Code 

```js
let x = "William Ding";

fire(x);

# Hi. I'm Jonah Bedouch. <Boop className="inline-flex cursor-default select-none" rotation={45} >ðŸ‘‹</Boop>

I'm a passionate software developer, public transit enthusiast, and coffee addict.
I'm currently in my **third year** of pursuing an **Electrical Engineering and Computer
Sciences B.S. at UC Berkeley**. I'm currently working on full stack infrastructure for Leap
XR. I have previously interned at Bosch US, where I worked on designing and developing
web dashboards for Nevonex.

I've primarily worked on backend and full stack development with Typescript and Python in the past,
but alongside software engineering I'm interested in systems, cybersecurity, and pedagogy.

When I'm not writing code, you can find me pulling shots of espresso, taking photos, playing games, 
trying to get Arch to work, and learning as much as I can about everything. If you have any questions 
or suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
